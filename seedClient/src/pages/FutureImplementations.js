    <h1>Here you can view our ideas for future implementations</h1>
    <p>  ___________________________________________________________________</p>
    <p> Due to the group losing two members during this CA3 we have not done nearly as much as we would have liked.</p>
    <p> We have however done all the basic implementations that were required. And we are quite satisfied with what we ended up having done.</p>
    <p> For this assignment going forward we would like to complete a wide range of improvements. </p>
    <p> Errorhandling, better feedback to the user on the website, and added functionality. </p>
    <p> Some of these ideas for the future can be seen in the use cases below. </p>
    
    <p>  ___________________________________________________________________</p>
    <h4> Here is a list of possible use cases for the semester project</h4>
    <h5> The name indicates the name of the use case</h5>
    <h5> The description describes what the user wants to be able to do with the use case</h5>
    <h5> The estimate indicate how long the use case should take for 1 man to complete (1 day = 8 work hours)</h5>
    <h5> The imporance shows how relevant we think the use case is for the product owner (higher points = higher importance)</h5>
    <h5> The feasibility is how likely we are to complete the use case with our current programming skills (unlikely, likely, very likely)</h5>
